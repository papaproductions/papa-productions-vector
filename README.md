# Papa productions Vector

Papa productions Vector is a free, vector-based and open source drawing program. It's a rewrite of an old Adobe AIR program I wrote a long time ago that went under the same name. Note that it is still in beta and some features are missing or buggy.

# Building

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install all necessary dependencies running `npm install`.
3. Write an empty array (`[]`) to `recent.json`.
4. Copy `./node_modules/electron/dist/` into a separate directory and create a directory named `app` in `resources`.
5. Copy the entire source code to that `app` directory.

# WHY IS THIS CODE IN SPANISH???

Sorry. It's a bad habit of mine, I'll rename everything eventually.
